## What is [Deno](https://deno.land/)?

> [Deno](https://deno.land/) is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js, and is focused on productivity and security.

* Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.

* Supports TypeScript out of the box.

* Ships only a single executable file.

* Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).

* Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno: [deno.land/std](https://deno.land/std)
