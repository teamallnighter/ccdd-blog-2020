This app uses [Air Table](https://airtable.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to update data. Normally you would need a programming language to update your database on the back end.

Once your app is set up you can have clients or staff Create Remove Update and Delete (CRUD) data on your database AND overwrite it on the back end.
