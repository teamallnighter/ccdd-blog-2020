Netlify is a serverless web hosting service that replaces the monoliphic server and database system. Instead of one server located in a data centre some where, your site is stored on a content deliver network that is distributed and saved all over the world. This ensures your site is fast every where in the world!

Netlify allows for form handeling on the free service as well as identity (logins) and includes Netlify CMS that allows you to set up a no code content management system.
