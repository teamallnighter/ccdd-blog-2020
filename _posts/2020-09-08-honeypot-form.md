This is a spam filtering technique where we put a hidden field 
into the form. A human can't see it and it's not required. 

```html
<!--We use the following to tell netlify what we are doing and what field is the honeypot-->
     <form class="form-template-v3" method="POST" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" data-netlify="true">
```

```html
<!--This is the field. -->
          <p class="hidden" style="display:none">
            <label>Donâ€™t fill this out if you're human: <input name="bot-field" /></label>
          </p>
```

However a bot WILL fill it in. Then we know it's spam.

It's a lot eaiser on the user than using a captcha.
