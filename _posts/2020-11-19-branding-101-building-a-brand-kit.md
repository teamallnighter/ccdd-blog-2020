## What Is A Brand Kit

A brand kit is a short and easy to use guide to your brand.  It's a quick reference to your identity that includes logos, colors, fonts, and messaging that represent your companies image, identity and tone.

Your brand kit can be distributed to owners, employees, partners, sub trades or, you can make it public.

For example the [spotify brand kit](https://developer.spotify.com/branding-guidelines/) not only includes visual assets but also necessary legal and licensing information for using the companyâ€™s content and metadata. As such, the kit helps protect Spotify as well as its partners, and it ensures that the brand image remains unified across customer experiences.

## Why Tho

There are a lot of reasons why you would want to have a brand kit. The main and most important reason is that it prevents your brand image from becoming diluted or misrepresented.

Another great example is [Netlifx's Brand Kit](https://brand.netflix.com/en/assets/)

## What Should Be Included

What is included in your brand kit is up to you. What matters most?

Here are some to start you off:

- Your Logo's
- Color palette
- Typography (fonts)
- Tone

## Tools

There are SO many tools out there to set up a branding kit. There are two that I use over and over.

### Canva

Canva is great! it's free and it is very easy to use. When you set up your brand kit, every project after that comes set up with your brands logo, colors and typography ready to go! There are some things that aren't included but these can be added easily. This would be great for internal use.

### Notion

Notion is one of my favorite tools. Not just for branding but just about everything! I manage most things for my business with notion. It is a very flexible tool that can do just about everything you'd need. The best part is they have a free tier and after that it is $4 a month.  You can export everything into PDF, Markdown or even HTML.
