This app uses Netlify functions to easily, quickly and, cheaply deploy a graph ql database to Netlify. This is a secure and easy way to store your data on the web. From here we can build an app that collects the data, displays it and allows us to manipulate it from your app.

Traditionally we would be pulling all of the data in with an API. With Graph QL, we can bring in parts of data, all the data or, whatever we want. Because this site is stored along side the app or website, it is more secure than using a traditional set up.
