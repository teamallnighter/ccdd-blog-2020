## What Is Google Light House

> Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

[Google Lighthouse Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

## Accessing Google Light House From Chrome

For now I am not going too deep into the chrome dev tools as that is a little out side the scope of thie article. If you want to know more about the dev tools, check out these two links:

[Chrome Dev Tools Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/javascript)

[Chrome Dev Tools Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

For now, we just need to know they exist. Inside of chrome click on view -> Developer -> JavaScript Console

![JavaScript Console](/assets/images/google-dev-tools.png)

From there you will see a pop out from the side of chrome. This is the devtools.

Click on the arrows to load more of the menu.

From here click on 'Lighthouse'

From this menu, select what tests you would like to run and if you would like the test to be run for desktop or mobile. If you don't know what a PWA is, make sure it's not clicked. Other than that you can test for all of the selections at once.
