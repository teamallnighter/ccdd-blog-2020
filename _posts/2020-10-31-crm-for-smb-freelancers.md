## What is a CRM

is one of many different approaches that allow a company to manage and analyse its own interactions with its past, current and potential customers.It uses data analysis about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.

One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater for their needs.

## Why do you need a CRM

### Analytics

Most CRM's offer a great amount of data on all sorts of things like time management, leads, satisfaction, projects and more. Your CRM should give you detailed graphs and visuals on the data. As you can imagine, this information is very valuable. If you're like me and, set goals for yourself tracking this data can be a pain.

### Customer Service

With most SMB's the number one thing in our lives is customer satisfaction. We can't always afford a marketing plan and word of mouth is one of the best forms of marketing. With a solid CRM you can automate a lot of the tasks involved with tracking customer service. Most CRM's will come with a customer service pipeline to help your customers get the service they need easily AND help you and your staff provide better service fast and easily.

Being able to track the service with surveys and reporting is vital. Your CRM should offer insight on how long a ticket takes to close and send out surveys to your customers once they do.

## Who Is A CRM For

Literally everyone! As a freelancer I couldn't imagine running my business without my trusty CRM. It makes my life so much easier and my clients love it too. If you are a freelancer, consultant, small, medium or even an enterprise, you need a CRM.

## How To Choose The Right CRM

### Set Up Time

Cloud-hosted solutions can be deployed faster than on-premises ones.

Look for a CRM with good support and a large user community to easily resolve setup difficulties.

### Ease Of Use

Many CRMs put a strong emphasis on ease of use.

Find a tool with good data visualization and that provides streamlined apps to help your salespeople enter and access data on the go.

### Price

Most CRMs offer a free trial, to help your team evaluate the tool at no cost. CRMs range in price from “free” to “high-ticket enterprise sales”; find one that works within your budget.

### Add Ons

What does the CRM offer besides lead capture and outreach? Consider looking for a tool with a rich integration library to take advantage of connections with other services you may use.

## Self Hosted VS. Cloud

When it comes to self hosted VS cloud There are many things that need to be considered. For me the main reason I went with self hosted was cost. I paid one price one time and I am good to go. Talk to your IT person to figure what the best option for you is.
