It takes files created by your dev and renders them down into a static site. Meaning, the site stays the same whoever is on it. Most companies just need a static site. 

For example, Facebook IS NOT static. It is different for each person. 

Jekyll is one of the original static site generators and it is one of the most popular. With Jekyll your dev can easily add on an admin section for you to login and create content without any code.

Jekyll sites can also be hosted for free on [Github](https://github.com) where your dev is probably hosting code already!

With Netlify, we can still process forms and even have logins for free. 

Jekyll is for sure an awesome system for small and medium sized business'</content><author><name>Chris Connelly</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="Jamstack" /><category term="Static Site Generators" /><category term="Netlify" /><summary type="html">Jekyll is lightweight easy to use and, developer friendly</summary></entry></feed>
