&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;is a web page that is delivered to the user’s web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a static website is a website that doesn’t change based on the user. The site is served to the user exactly as it was stored. This doesn’t mean that the page can’t have dynamic thing inside of it. For example, you could have a page that IS static oull data from the weather network and display it but, the API will still be pulled no matter who lands on that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Dynamic page would be like facebook. This page, if you looked at it on the server wouldn’t display anything until it knows who the user is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-i-use-a-static-page&quot;&gt;When should I use a static page?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, just about everyone should be using a static page unless you are building a web app. Most companies will only require a static page. If your page needs to tell people who you are and provide contact information a static page will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static page no longer requires the large ecosystem that webpages required or that dynamic pages require now. A static page can be hosted through Github and Netlify saving your comapny a lot of money and your dev a lot of head ache.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Connelly</name></author><category term="Static Site" /><category term="Static Site Generators" /><category term="Static Site" /><summary type="html">Basically, a static site is when the content doesn'y change based on the user...</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/cover-2.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/cover-2.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Netlify, Airtable and React App</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/airtable/netlify/2020/09/03/netlify-airtable.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Netlify, Airtable and React App" /><published>2020-09-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-09-03T07:25:52-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/airtable/netlify/2020/09/03/netlify-airtable</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/airtable/netlify/2020/09/03/netlify-airtable.html">&lt;p&gt;This app uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com&quot;&gt;Air Table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlify.com&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; to update data.

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally we would be pulling all of the data in with an API. With Graph QL, we can bring in parts of data, all the data or, whatever we want.

It takes files created by your dev and renders them down into a static site. Meaning, the site stays the same whoever is on it. Most companies just need a static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Facebook IS NOT static. It is different for each person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is one of the original static site generators and it is one of the most popular. With Jekyll your dev can easily add on an admin section for you to login and create content without any code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll sites can also be hosted for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; where your dev is probably hosting code already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Netlify, we can still process forms and even have logins for free.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of one server located in a data centre some where, your site is stored on a content deliver network that is distributed and saved all over the world. This ensures your site is fast every where in the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify allows for form handeling on the free service as well as identity (logins) and includes Netlify CMS that allows you to set up a no code content management system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Connelly</name></author><category term="Netlify" /><category term="Netlify" /><category term="Jamstack" /><summary type="html">Netlify has free services to get your site started!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/netlify.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/netlify.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
